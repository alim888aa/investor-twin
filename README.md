## Application Description

This application finds the customer with the most similar investments for a given username. It uses MongoDB's sample Analytics dataset and Atlas Vector Search for its core logic. The search was enabled by creating one-hot encoded vectors for each customer's unique stock symbols and storing them in the database (vectorize.ts).

When a user enters their username, the app finds the user in the database and does a $vectorSearch on their portfolio vectors to identify the top five customers with similar portfolios (search.ts). Finally, the application finds all unique stocks of the most similar twin and passes them with the user's unique stocks to the AI to analyze the difference between their portfolios.

The MongoDB functions to create vector embeddings were done locally while the rest of the application was developed using Firebase Studio.
